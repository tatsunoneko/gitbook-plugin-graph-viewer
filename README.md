# gitbook-plugin-img-viewer
An image viewer plugin for gitbook

### About this plugin
Hey guys, this is my first open-source project, hopfully this plugin could satisfy your needs of viewing images in your gitbooks.

Currently, this is just a simple version, it just provides features like zoom-in and zoom-out. Of course, there would be more and more useful functions in the future.

If you encountered with any issue or got any idea about this plugin, feel free to contact me through [email](mailto:wang@zichen.tech).

[Get this plugin from npm!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitbook-plugin-graph-viewer)

**Thanks!**
